# Excel-Dashboard

## Project Objective

A Coffee Shop wants to create sales report for four years(2019-2022). So that the owner of the coffee can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023-2025.

## Questions (KPI)

1- Which year(month) got the highest sales and orders?

2- Compare the sales by country using bar chart.

3- Which coffee type ordered more?

4- List Top 5 customers contributing the sales.

## Process

. Verify data for any missing values.

. Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.

. Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.

. Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicers to make dynamic.

## Final Coclusion

To improve the sales of this coffee shop, a strategic marketing plan focused on Dark Roast type size 2 kg and more for those who are residing in United Kingdom should be implemented.
This demographic represents a key consumer segment, as they often order significant coffee orders for large sizes but with no loyalty card mostly. So the approach should include targeted digital marketing campaigns and personalized promotions for Arabica & Liberica coffee types especially.
